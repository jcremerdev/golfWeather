## Golf Weather 
https://jcremerdev.github.io/golfWeather/



The original intention of this app was to strictly search for golf courses in a designated area and list weather details over a specified amount of time.

The function of this app now, is to search a single place designated by the user in the search bar. This place returns a precise location, shown below the search bar, as well as weather data for the current day and the six days ahead. Google places allows the user to search a place by it's colloquial name as well as addresses, and other specific identifiers. The more specific the better. Google Places API also has a world-wide database of locations, so the user may search anywhere on the globe.
