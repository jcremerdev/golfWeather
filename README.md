# golfWeather 
The original intention of this app was to strictly search for golf courses in a designated area and list weather details over a specified amount of time.

The function of this app now, is to search a single place designated by the user in the search bar. This place returns a pin on the map as well as weather details for that person.
APIs used are the google places API and OpenWeatherMap API.

This first version is the MVP and just adheres to the minimum requirements of the first step of this project:
Using Fetch to asynchronously load data from one or more APIs
Using jQuery's DOM traversal and manipulation functionality to display the data from the API to the user in an interesting way
Using jQuery's event listening capabilities to respond to user actions.

This app will have one or more features added before it's final draft, but as for now, it follows the basic requirements.
